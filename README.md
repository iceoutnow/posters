# posters

We've made some posters. They're all in the public domain, and we encourage you to print out your own and put them up. We also encourage you to create your
own and submit them via pull requests. Please make sure to include the QR code for this repository if you do so.

If you wish to print more posters, please be aware that your printer may add steganographic [tracking dots], so it might be worthwhile to print at a library.
